I got the refund in the next couple of days but no one showed up to pick up the product so I called the customer care again, they told me that I could throw it away, since no one would be coming to pick it up. I thanked them and threw my phone and rushed to my iPad to apply the tempered glass on it. I'm still using it, as the crack is not hindering my usage for it is cracked only in the corner.So eventually I have my money and the product as well :)"
