79,10194,2015-08-11 00:00:00,q,"Sundar started as Product managers , worked hard for 11 years . It is his hard work, all credits goes to him only."
81,10195,2015-08-11 00:00:00,q,I don't think so 'credit' is the right word here . But Indians can definitely feel proud about it .India is the country which provided him the platform to groom himself.
81,10196,2015-08-11 00:00:00,q,United States might have made him a great leader or capable CEO but first India made him a great engineer (with due respect to the  talent sundar possesses and the contributions made by his family members)
83,10197,2015-08-11 00:00:00,q,Noo..not India...but yes the nationality should get the credit..Hats off to the man n of course T he Indians ..we can make anything possible:)
82,10198,2015-08-13 00:00:00,q,NO!! We as Indians are happy for him but today whatever he has achieved is only because of his planing and hard work and full credit should go to him and his family.
58,10199,2015-08-16 00:00:00,q,"Fortunately, that relationship has  been  and is already well leveraged."
58,10200,2015-08-16 00:00:00,q,"The first generation of Indian workforces which migrated after graduating from top schools (like IITs) in the 1960s and 70s, are  now  executives, investors and Professors in areas where they have helped offshore work to India."
58,10201,2015-08-16 00:00:00,q,The IT-boom in India was enabled quite efficiently due to the lobbying efforts of this generation of Indian-Americans.
58,10202,2015-08-16 00:00:00,q,"Similarly, this small population wields a disproportionate political acumen (relative to its size, probably negligible as a whole though), which is pushing for greater business co-operation and even the original nuclear deal."
58,10203,2015-08-16 00:00:00,q, It was this group which cheered for Modi at Madison Square Garden as they were cheering for India and for themselves.
58,10204,2015-08-16 00:00:00,q,"But  overall, the South Asian community in the USA is <4 million total, while the East Asian origin community is at least 10 million."
58,10205,2015-08-16 00:00:00,q,Thus these countries have a much larger clout in terms of cultural impact and visible presence in  Amreeka.
58,10206,2015-08-16 00:00:00,q," Given the size of the desi community and much more  recent  history of migration there, I doubt it can increase beyond present levels."
80,10207,2015-08-19 00:00:00,q,"The question is if India wants to take credit for Sundar Pichai’s success, why in the world, he had to move to the US for better prospects? Let success or failure be an individual phenomenon."
80,10208,2015-08-19 00:00:00,q,"When the society does not support an individual during his failures, it doesn’t deserve to share the joy of his/her success."

53,10210,2015-09-11 00:00:00,q,If you are really good than you don't need to be afraid of going to US or MS once you are  there.no  one care about the past academics.they would emphasize on B.tech cgpa.find a universiy in california and you would land up in microsoft/google/FB/apple/IBM.
59,10211,2015-09-28 00:00:00,q,In india google map is accurate whis precious gps location U have to provide extreme gps settings to get accurate location It works very good...........
60,10212,2015-09-29 00:00:00,q,It is almost fine . But not updated frequently . You may not see new roads very soon in the maps.
36,10213,2015-10-27 00:00:00,q,Join a consultant/body shopper in US and get in there first on an H1.
36,10214,2015-10-27 00:00:00,q,There are quite a few out there ready to make money by placing you at some local company once you reach there.
36,10215,2015-10-27 00:00:00,q,They take the risk of getting you out there and get paid by charging commissions while placing you at some local company on contract position.
36,10216,2015-10-27 00:00:00,q, Apply for MSFT/Google once you are on H1 out there.
36,10217,2015-10-27 00:00:00,q,H1 transfer is something MSFT/Google would readily do after they interview you multiple times over the phone and for a whole full day on campus face to face.
36,10218,2015-10-27 00:00:00,q,and follow the following steps.
36,10219,2015-10-27 00:00:00,q,"1)Make your resume stronger.Participate in codechef , interviewstreet etc 2)Some big companies also have 24 hr coding events on interviewstreet etc 3)Amazon recently had a code ninja event.They also have code ninja on their website.If you solve that you may get a interview call Last : prepare hard by going to  Programming Interview Questions | CareerCup And yes i have seen people from tcs get into amazon."
36,10220,2015-10-27 00:00:00,q,Its very difficulty but not impossible.
36,10221,2015-10-27 00:00:00,q,CGPA does not matter for big companies .I have seen 9 pointers who suck at coding.
36,10222,2015-10-27 00:00:00,q,"Most impt thing :You need to passionate for coding.If you are not then there is no point . Another approach (Indirect but more feasible) : Get into some decent product dev company like oracle , symantec, pega."
36,10223,2015-10-27 00:00:00,q,Having this name on your resume will increase your chances of getting call from big companies.
36,10224,2015-10-27 00:00:00,q,Bipul Jaiswal

93,10226,2015-11-20 00:00:00,q,"But sorry, I'm not the right person to answer this."
93,10227,2015-11-20 00:00:00,q,"I don't have a sufficient knowledge on this topic, so i suggest you to inquire about this in the search bar of Quora."
93,10228,2015-11-20 00:00:00,q,You will find lot of related queries and you may fight best answers written by the industry experts.
93,10229,2015-11-20 00:00:00,q,You will be guided in a right manner there.
93,10230,2015-11-20 00:00:00,q,"So many students have queries related to this, you may search for those topics in the search bar, and even you will get to know what kind of preparation is needed for your query."
93,10231,2015-11-20 00:00:00,q,All the best.
57,10232,2015-12-15 00:00:00,q,India should leverage this clout by getting higher education infrastructure strengthened in India.
57,10233,2015-12-15 00:00:00,q,"One way this can be done by improving indigenous research facilities, and making them more accessible to people, in more institutes."
57,10234,2015-12-15 00:00:00,q,This would give impetus to industry as well as academia.
57,10235,2015-12-15 00:00:00,q,"Indians are hungry for knowledge, and I've sensed the yearning for higher education in many people I've known."
57,10236,2015-12-15 00:00:00,q,"This results in many people leaving the country, whereas if the scope, opportunity and infrastructure for cutting edge research was improved in India - say, by procuring expensive capital equipment for research - we'd open up Indian academia to many more people."
57,10237,2015-12-15 00:00:00,q,Thanks for the A2A.
69,10238,2016-02-20 00:00:00,q,Start with Moment of Inspiration 3D.

69,10240,2016-02-20 00:00:00,q,It's a very simple software that will introduce you to the concept of nurbs modelling.
69,10241,2016-02-20 00:00:00,q,"You can parallely branch out to three domains, viz Parametric Modelling, SubD modelling, and Hybrid Modelling (a combination of the two, eg TSplines technology) "
37,10242,2016-03-19 00:00:00,q,Applying directly and getting a job is very very hard.
37,10243,2016-03-19 00:00:00,q,Check jobs in amazon or Google us and apply on them.
37,10244,2016-03-19 00:00:00,q," Some of the time if your profile,  skills sets are high they do take interview but the complexity rate is too Damm high but if you manage to Crack that all visa sponsorship will be done."
37,10245,2016-03-19 00:00:00,q," Other easy way,  Join any MS program,  it will good for your career as well."
37,10246,2016-03-19 00:00:00,q," During MS,  make sure to score high and build things,  keep a good contact with professors."
37,10247,2016-03-19 00:00:00,q," There will be a good chance of getting internship in Google or ms,  perform well,  job visa all is yours including degree from good University"
116,10248,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,Whether to be an IAS or take up a job at Google will vary from person to person.
116,10249,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q," Those people having an inclination towards technology, love coding, solving problems will find Google job more appealing."
116,10250,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,"While those who enjoy working with people, multitasking, doing plenty of repetitive work and man management are inclined towards civil services."
116,10251,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q," Also, a job at Google is financially far more remunerative than that of an IAS."
116,10252,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,"An IAS has to work really hard, maneuver through political hurdles (given one really wants to work), tackle difficult people, etc."
116,10253,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,In return the rewards may not be that lucrative and can even lead to a political backlash.
116,10254,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,Whereas at Google the challenges are more technical in nature.
116,10255,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,But in civil services there is a satisfaction of contributing to the society and directly affecting the lives of millions of people.
116,10256,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,The diversity of job profiles an IAS holds is immense which is not there in a Google job.
116,10257,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,"But still it remains a matter of choice whether one wants to be an expert at one thing and keep doing it throughout life or be a generalist, a jack of all trades."
116,10258,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,The former suits a Google job and the latter IAS.
117,10259,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,This is a very very very subjective question.
117,10260,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,"People might give you complicated and logical answers but if you LOVE being a coder (I am assuming thats your position at Google) or if you LOVE being in the administrative service, you have your answer."
117,10261,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q," They are both good options and the highest achievable options in those fields, so its just a matter of knowing what you really want to do in life and what you love."
117,10262,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q, This is all based on what the individual loves.
117,10263,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q, 
118,10264,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,"IAS, it's about respect and service than salary."
118,10265,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,"You can be the CEO of Google as well, but the Number of lives you can touch and impact directly or indirectly is more in an IAS in 30yrs of your service."
118,10266,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,This is my view.
119,10267,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,Surely I will select IAS.
119,10268,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,Because by joining IAS I can serve people to a minimum level atleast.
119,10269,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,"Though google can also enables, but my personal interest is to take IAS."
119,10270,2016-03-20 00:00:00,q,"As answered by others, It depends upon personal interest too."
91,10271,2016-04-13 00:00:00,q,Yes I have seen Google having open positions for Android developers in Google Hyderabad via Linkedin .
103,10272,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,Rs.

103,10278,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,"It was the #1 Bestseller and had around 1000 reviews at the time of my purchase (last week) and I immediately ordered one! My experience with this is below par, I would say bad."
103,10279,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,The screen just appears magnified with significant loss in quality.
103,10280,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,"It's pixelated and feels like watching a video on some old 2.8"" screen phone."
103,10281,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,"Just bigger like a cinema hall, but worst quality."
103,10282,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,And the video is also blurred to some extent.
103,10283,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,"I tried cleaning the lenses, adjusting my phone's distance to the lenses etc.. but it was of no use."
103,10284,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,"I tried different apps like VR player free, VR cinema and the native Google cardboard app."
103,10285,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,I downloaded 360 degree videos from YouTube in 1080p resolution and used some normal 2D videos from my phone.
103,10286,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,I use Lenovo K3 note which has 1920x1080 screen resolution.
103,10287,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,The videos otherwise look good on the screen but sadly with cardboard they look bad :( I have tried different combinations of apps and video resolutions.
103,10288,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,I noticed that the distance at which the apps render the video in front of your eye makes a significant difference to the experience.
103,10289,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,The father the better.
103,10290,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,The best I could do with this cardboard was to watch a few music videos in Google cardboard app.
103,10291,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,360 videos in VR player were a let down as it was a very bad quality video experience overall.
103,10292,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,IMHO 360 degree videos are experienced much better without the cardboard.
103,10293,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,"To add to my troubles, the magnetic button does not work on my phone."
103,10294,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,I had to remove the magnet assembly from the cardboard for viewing 360 degree videos.
103,10295,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,Lenovo K3 note has a virtual gyroscope (Software based gyroscope). The magnet interferes with it somehow and it does not work with the magnet at all.
103,10296,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,FYI: Lenovo K3 not does not fit in it.
103,10297,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,It is bigger than the cardboard.
103,10298,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,So some adjustment will be needed.
103,10299,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q, I wonder why so many people gave it a good rating on Amazon.. Either they had no clue what to expect or they just got excited to see their video on a big screen :P Your experience may vary based on your phone or the pair of lenses in your cardboard and other factors.
103,10300,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,Maybe mine were not the best of the lot.
103,10301,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,But this did not hurt much as I was prepared for it anyway.
103,10302,2016-04-16 00:00:00,q,;-)
10,10303,2016-05-13 00:00:00,q,I assume you are asking about career options for a person who is well versed with Google Analytics.
10,10304,2016-05-13 00:00:00,q,"If that is the case, I should say it’s not bad but not great."
10,10305,2016-05-13 00:00:00,q,"A lot of people work on Google Analytics but what differentiates a person is his ability to learn new web analytics tools, JavaScript programming and understanding things like omni channel and data management platforms."
13,10306,2016-05-21 00:00:00,q,Visit  Google Analytics Skill Salary - PayScale  and check the scope of Google Analytics in India.
99,10307,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,"No sir, it's not Google that is marking India as a Nanak Haram country."
99,10308,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,This is merely a troll by exploiting Google's search algorithm.
99,10309,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q, Namak Haram  was a very famous movie of Bollywood.
99,10310,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,"When you search namak Haram country, you see the country in which the movie was made."
99,10311,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,People have been trolling us over this (from our favourite neighbouring country) Here's an example.
99,10312,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,If you google “Lord of the rings country” you get  UK.
99,10313,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,Several articles by news websites have also been for the same.
99,10314,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,"Hi I'm Apurva, I know stuff."
100,10315,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,I can think of a few reasons.
100,10316,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,Building a search engine that can compete with Google is not easy.
100,10317,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,It takes a lot of resources.
100,10318,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,A lot.
100,10319,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,"You need a lot of servers for all the crawling, indexing, ranking, etc."
100,10320,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,"Even if he came up with a search engine of his own, would you actually use it? Most people would just use Google anyway as it works well and is popular."
100,10321,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,I'm pretty sure he doesn't know the roadmap to building and expanding a search engine.
100,10322,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,He is the CEO but he was appointed fairly recently.
100,10323,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,He is the CEO of Google.
100,10324,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,"If that's not a satisfying and well paying job, I don't know what is."
100,10325,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,These were just 4 reasons and I'm sure there are a lot more.
100,10326,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,"Simply put, Google has pretty much captured the entire search engine market in India."
100,10327,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,And building and operating a search engine of that magnitude is not even remotely easy.
100,10328,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,"So unless someone comes up with a revolutionary new way to search for content on the Web, I don't think Google would be replaced."
100,10329,2016-09-28 00:00:00,q,"Even if someone did, I would be skeptical"

39,10333,2016-11-05 00:00:00,q,Apply for MSFT/Google once you are on H1 out there.
39,10334,2016-11-05 00:00:00,q,H1 transfer is something MSFT/Google would readily do after they interview you multiple times over the phone and for a whole full day on campus face to face.

3,10385,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,Google search works on key words.
3,10386,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,For example if you type “stupid” in Google search you will see all photos hash tagged with this word.
3,10387,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,You can see Jackie Chan in first photo because someone hash tagged (leveled) his photo as stupid.
3,10388,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,"If you type “hot”, you will see all bold photos of models, actresses."

3,10392,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,If you hash tag “smart” word as much as possible to his photos then google will show you his same photos as smart.
3,10393,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,It's magic of key word search.

4,10395,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,"Google search is all statistics, weight, relative weight of words and phrases."
4,10396,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,"To humans, who is most stupid is open to contention."
4,10397,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,"For Google, most important words/phrase in the given query is Prime minister of India, thus it shows Narendra Modi’s image."
5,10398,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,The reason behind this search result is the search algorithm used in Google.
5,10399,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,"It works with key words and the words closely related to it, it also factors the location you are in and your previous searches as well."
5,10400,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,So in this case the search words are Most stupid Prime Minister of India/ World.
5,10401,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,"The word Stupid is co-related to Prime Minister Modi by the article titled in Reuters ‘  Why work with India’s new leader? It’s the economy, stupid  And the rest of the perfectly match with PM Modi . Thus we see PM Modi in the results."
5,10402,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,He was even featured in Google’s query result of  Top 10 criminals of India.
5,10403,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q, They did apologise for it but it was all due to search algorithms.
5,10404,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,(It has nothing to do with him or his Deeds)
6,10405,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,"This has something to do with Algo (Algorithm) Search engine…It means that what u type in the search engine (Google) it shows u the result…Now try searching “Rahul is an Idiot r Sonia is corrupt” surprisingly ull get more of QUORA searches and YOUTUBE videos…Pretty sure this is how it works…BTW, We have got this amazing, hardworking and a dedicated PM Mr.Modi and if ppl can't see it now they'll definitely will in the coming days…?"
7,10406,2017-02-15 00:00:00,q,Google is not god.

1,10414,2017-02-16 00:00:00,q,"To know why Google shows our P.M Modi's image for the queries like “World's top 10 criminals”, one should know about SEO(Search Engine Optimization) and how Google's page rank algorithm works."
1,10415,2017-02-16 00:00:00,q,SEO: Consider SEO as something like names of children which teachers use to search a student in a class.
1,10416,2017-02-16 00:00:00,q,SEO is achieved using <meta> tag embedded into a web page (HTML document). Meta tags consists of keywords and description which would have queries SEO analyst thinks that search engine users might search.

1,10418,2017-02-16 00:00:00,q,Google usually use these keywords to put your website's link on Google's search results.
1,10419,2017-02-16 00:00:00,q,Page rank algorithm: Consider page rank algorithm as grades of students in a class.
1,10420,2017-02-16 00:00:00,q,"But, here students are replaced with websites."
1,10421,2017-02-16 00:00:00,q,Google rank websites according to the traffic they get (views or clicks) for the respective search query.
1,10422,2017-02-16 00:00:00,q,"For example, if you search “quora”, quora's site link will be the top result, because for that query, loads of people would've clicked that link that other links."
1,10423,2017-02-16 00:00:00,q,"So, it places each link on it's search result according to the rank."
1,10424,2017-02-16 00:00:00,q,"Conclusion: Some morons made bunch of dumb articles with meta tag keywords like “world's top ten criminals”, “most stupid prime Minister”, etc."
1,10425,2017-02-16 00:00:00,q,"Unfortunately, many people clicked those links and made them top of the results."
1,10426,2017-02-16 00:00:00,q,Ps.
1,10427,2017-02-16 00:00:00,q,Google isn't responsible for these search results since they do not show them purposefully.

45,10434,2017-02-19 00:00:00,q,Friend I think after two years working in Google you have many better options for higher studies.
45,10435,2017-02-19 00:00:00,q,You can pursue your interest from better abroad institutions than IIT.
45,10436,2017-02-19 00:00:00,q,I am not saying that IITs are not good but you should always choose best option.
45,10437,2017-02-19 00:00:00,q,I must say that higher qualification and industrial experience will give you benefit.
46,10438,2017-02-19 00:00:00,q,"What are you seeking for I mean are you interested in research , do you wish to improve your skills or you wanna change your job profile . Considering all these factor we can come to a conclusion."
46,10439,2017-02-19 00:00:00,q,What is your educational background i.e from institue you have done graduation? If you were from an private institution or state level college then definetlyyou have missed a lot which an IITian go through.
46,10440,2017-02-19 00:00:00,q,"Rigorous academic shedule of IIT , top notch facilities for research , foreign exchange program , internship in leading organisations, rich culture of campus , healthy atmosphere among students , zeal of learning new things for that clubs , societies helps candidate proffesionally."
46,10441,2017-02-19 00:00:00,q,"world class sports facility, extra curicullar activities , career oriented trainings , fun activities , cultural clubs ,well associated commities and transparent working of SENATE and each body of instiute."
46,10442,2017-02-19 00:00:00,q,"NO other organisation in INDIA will have such system , where a person can improve skills and learn a lot with freedom."
46,10443,2017-02-19 00:00:00,q,IIT’s are the undoubtedly the best institue and they are totally worth for.
85,10444,2017-02-20 00:00:00,q,"There are many ways: Google conducts APAC(now  Kickstart 2017 ), you may get an intern interview call if you perform well."

115,10450,2017-02-20 00:00:00,q,There are many companies going great work in IoT and AI.
115,10451,2017-02-20 00:00:00,q,"Since AI and IoT Platform/Framework is provided by companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon etc it is just matter of assembly your solution."
115,10452,2017-02-20 00:00:00,q," I think Google and Apple is doing its job well, they might not launch specific solution for a country, it is start-ups and other companies which they enabled has the job of building custom solution which suites the use case."
115,10453,2017-02-20 00:00:00,q,Example: Cooey Technologies is working on both IoT and AI to enable smart health care.
115,10454,2017-02-20 00:00:00,q,The AI based virtual assistant called Maya can help elders or patients with little agility to log and interact with their medical data and caretaker.
115,10455,2017-02-20 00:00:00,q,The Maya engine is integrated with Amazon Alexa which can bring lot of possibilities.

44,10459,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,A2A.
44,10460,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,I will be very frank.
44,10461,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,"I am in Hyderabad, attended about 30 interviews in 2 months, sometimes I traveled 2 to 3 interviews on same day."
44,10462,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,"I din’t like any other interview, only Google interview I liked."
44,10463,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,The liked feeling of getting interviewed by Google.
44,10464,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,"I failed, even though I answered all."
44,10465,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,A month passed.
44,10466,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,"At this time, I understood 2 things: The way I answered was wrong: In the google docs, I conveyed that one problem is difficult than other problems, generally I dont do, but did this."
44,10467,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,"At that time, I was around 600 rank, my intelligence was really raw, I dint know the complexity of many things I solved."
44,10468,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,Complexity would surely help.
44,10469,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,"By raw intelligence I mean, I might solve a difficult problem that most people dint solve, and may be I will not solve that one rare thing that almost 80% people solved somehow, as seen from leaderboard."
44,10470,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,I wrote 0 test cases for each of the 3 problems.
44,10471,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,This is a serious problem.
44,10472,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,"When we submit an answer, our answer is checked against 20 test cases on a competitive programming website, but in google interview, you are the one who writes those test cases too."
44,10473,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,"Sure, I dont have a habit of checking code myself (unless those green tickets or red crosses tell me), plus, I dont remember well to write a perfect answer quickly, even it’s already solved problem."
44,10474,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,It is perfect disaster.
44,10475,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,":-). Well, problem solvers are not required anymore, before problem solver, you must be a good problem solution recaller, its the fate to cut competition in the modern days."
44,10476,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,"Also understood that, the good feeling I felt in Google interview, is nothing to do with Google, but it is to do with Algorithms that I like."
44,10477,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,It is to do with the problem solving in Algorithms that I like.
44,10478,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,"In other words, If Google interview calls me to interview for a chemist position, assuming it is there, I would not even care to attend unless for a good reason."
44,10479,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,"In future, if Google’s business decides ‘we have nothing to do with problem solving’, then I will be like ‘I have nothing to do with Google’ I like Google for the extraordinary things that it already does & tries to do for future."
44,10480,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,"But my like towards problem solving or algorithms is much stronger than the like towards Google or other company, so is the reason behind above like answer."
44,10481,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,"Hope the above answer, or some parts of it helps someone."
44,10482,2017-03-02 00:00:00,q,Best of luck.
109,10483,2017-03-03 00:00:00,q,Yes.
109,10484,2017-03-03 00:00:00,q,Google has started rolling out Google Assistant to Android Marshmallow.
109,10485,2017-03-03 00:00:00,q,"However the update is currently restricted to US, Canada, UK and Australia."
109,10486,2017-03-03 00:00:00,q,So guess you will have to wait.
109,10487,2017-03-03 00:00:00,q,"But if you can't, you can install it by flashing it manually."
110,10488,2017-03-10 00:00:00,q,"You can get it now automatically if you sign up for  Google app beta  and  Google play services beta  programs, OR you can wait for it to go public for stable builds."
110,10489,2017-03-10 00:00:00,q,The good thing is that it also supports English (India) voice.
110,10490,2017-03-10 00:00:00,q,I’ve got it yesterday and found it way useful than siri or any other voice assistant as far as voice recognition and results are concerned.
110,10491,2017-03-10 00:00:00,q,A downside is that its voices are still a little bit robotic and available news sources are only from BBC.
110,10492,2017-03-10 00:00:00,q,Still worth a try!
43,10493,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"Hard as it may be to believe, I did not know much about Google at all when I had applied there."
43,10494,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,This was 10 years ago.
43,10495,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I was terribly low on industry awareness back then.
43,10496,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,Pretty much the only thing I had known about the company was that they had a popular search engine.
43,10497,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I did not know about their salaries or stocks or culture or reputation even.
43,10498,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I was applying only because my previous job was kinda degrading.
43,10499,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,They had started hiring in India only in the past couple of years or so.
43,10500,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,Couple of my ex-colleagues had gotten through to Google.
43,10501,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,These were the sharpest in my previous company and I was told it required enormous talent to get through their interview process.
43,10502,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,Few of my very talented friends had tried too and not gotten through.
43,10503,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,It almost baffled me then.
43,10504,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I too just thought I’ll give it a shot.
43,10505,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,There were other companies which were offering higher salaries back then and I had given them a shot too.
43,10506,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"Luckily, I did not get through one of the potential companies here :). Fate played its own role to take me to Google."
43,10507,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"So, this is how it went."
43,10508,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,It was one of my ex-colleagues who had referred me to Google.
43,10509,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,She was nice enough to write me a good referral.
43,10510,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,Google was quick to process my application and I walked in un-nervously on the day of the interview.
43,10511,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I don’t remember how my phone interview went though.
43,10512,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I am sure I had cleared the basics there uneventfully.
43,10513,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I hadn’t cared much at that point in time about whether I’d get the job or not.
43,10514,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,The on-site interview was fairly interesting and definitely quite intense.
43,10515,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I still vividly remember few of the questions I had to answer and one of them where I definitely struggled a lot.
43,10516,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,There was this one interviewer who’d later become my friend.
43,10517,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,The two of us would perform a fun dance event on stage in our last holiday party as we exited Google 4 years later at the same time.
43,10518,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,His interview was the one I had found the most difficult.
43,10519,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,There was one solution where I did not arrive at the most optimal solution despite a few hints from this guy.
43,10520,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I found the optimal approach ridiculously impossible.
43,10521,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"No matter what I tried, there was some barrier that kept preventing the solution from reducing to O(N). This guy did not meet my eyes and was constantly on his laptop, presumably taking notes."
43,10522,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,He would ask me questions and stretch my answers with every little step I took.
43,10523,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,He was pretty sharp but left me a bit tense about it all.
43,10524,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"Ultimately, I solved his questions but did not reach the last level of optimization that was presumably possible."
43,10525,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"Later on, I would come to know of a few people who had solved it in the interview."
43,10526,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,But I knew I hadn’t bombed his interview either.
43,10527,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I had been able to analytically reason out with him on most aspects without floundering or exhibiting any lack of clarity.
43,10528,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I also remember another fairly senior interviewer with whom I had just cracked his medium complexity problem solving question instantly - like in 5 seconds or so.
43,10529,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I had the answer even as he was just finishing his question.
43,10530,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"Subsequently, when I would use this question with other good candidates I’d interview, I observed that several of them would take anywhere from 5–10 minutes to solve it."
43,10531,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"On one of the coding questions in which I started on an iterative approach, it was pretty darn hard to get things working during the time of the interview."
43,10532,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"Gradually, I moved over to a recursive code and got it working."
43,10533,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,The interviewer pushed me to walk through the code path using an example and dive into the stack to demonstrate that the code had no bugs.
43,10534,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,It was a bit of an intense exercise and required enormous concentration back then.
43,10535,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I had to follow a thread of thought and trace through the details several levels deep into the stack for a few minutes at a stretch.
43,10536,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,But I got it in the end.
43,10537,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"Had I not taken this solution to its full completion, I am pretty sure I wouldn’t have gotten through."
43,10538,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"In the end, I was pretty confident that this particular interviewer would have liked me."
43,10539,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"And yes, I remember the lunch."
43,10540,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,There was a buddy who took me to the Google cafeteria and I was impressed by the spread they had.
43,10541,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"After 3 interviews that day, I was sent back home."
43,10542,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I kept wondering about it in the evening.
43,10543,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"I could tell that they would have found my analytical and coding abilities reasonable, but there were chances they found me slow on one problem at least."
43,10544,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"And I had only 3 F2F interviews, so I thought may be they sent me back because they did not want to process my candidature any further."
43,10545,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,Subsequently they called me for another interview on another day.
43,10546,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I solved all the questions on this one.
43,10547,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,The high complexity problem in this interview was very straightforward in code but required a specific insight for arriving at a linear solution.
43,10548,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"I was solid in my reasoning, but took my time and solved the problem."
43,10549,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I never floundered or left my confidence shake at any point.
43,10550,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I kept pushing until I had solved it.
43,10551,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"As I’d depart again from the office, I noticed the interviewer go out for a smoke and look pensive."
43,10552,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"Back then, I had thought that he was maybe thinking about how the interview went, but now I think he may have just stepped out for his regular break with N different things in his head where I may have likely not been a part."
43,10553,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"Later on, I had run into this guy several times at Google and he wouldn’t recognize me."
43,10554,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,He always hosted the same solitary pensive look.
43,10555,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"Finally, the offer came."
43,10556,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,They had liked my profile and took me in.
43,10557,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,I was happy to take it up.
43,10558,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"They had, in fact, hired me to play the role of a tech lead of a new monetization project in YouTube."
43,10559,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,This was the time when Youtube was bleeding money and they were just beginning to work on some innovative ideas to start monetizing it.
43,10560,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"But all this happened to me, while I had not even known what sort of a phenomenal company they are."
43,10561,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"In retrospect, I feel quite lucky for getting an opportunity to work at this absolutely wonderful company."
43,10562,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"Till date, the smartest technical people I have interacted with, date back to this place."
43,10563,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,That was my interview experience.
43,10564,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"Pretty uneventful overall, but few events of the day still stay vivid in my memories."
43,10565,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"When I recollect the whole thing today, it always ends with a recollection of the street in which I had walked back thoughtfully after the last interview and the traffic scene on the road near the junction where St."
43,10566,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,Mark’s road and Residency Road met.
43,10567,2017-03-11 00:00:00,q,"The honking sounds of vehicles all seem to come from very far away, but I realize that is just how my memory portrays the scene today."
78,10568,2017-03-15 00:00:00,q,I don’t understand the point of such questions being asked.
78,10569,2017-03-15 00:00:00,q,"It’s not exactly like Google comes in through to ISI gate, points at a random person and hands him a job."
78,10570,2017-03-15 00:00:00,q,It’s not lottery … I don’t know who have given you an impression such as that.
78,10571,2017-03-15 00:00:00,q,"Mtech CS, QROR; MSQE; Mstat; Mmath … all compete for the same positions."

23,10843,2017-05-06 00:00:00,q,One of the best perk to me thus far has been the ability to move roles based on your interest and future career aspirations So far in 2years what I have noticed at Google People move cross functions like from Ads to Maps.
23,10844,2017-05-06 00:00:00,q,I know a few people who even moved from Ads to Engineering teams People also move countries.
23,10845,2017-05-06 00:00:00,q,"I have few of my own colleagues who moved to US, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Dublin for various reasons."
23,10846,2017-05-06 00:00:00,q,"People also move across India too like Hyd to Mumbai or Gurgaon So the answer is  yes , you can get a job at Google India and internally apply for roles in Zurich or any other place accross the world where Google has an office."
23,10847,2017-05-06 00:00:00,q,"Provided your application is internally approved by your manager and you clear the interviews required for the new role.( Internal interviews are more role related and not to check your personality or Googleyness) Also, Google India has a team which helps you filing work Visa documentation for various countries."
23,10848,2017-05-06 00:00:00,q,This shows how common this practice is :) Hope this helps!
22,10849,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,It’s very common for Googlers across the globe to change there job internally and relocate to another country.
22,10850,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,Google India is no different.
22,10851,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,I have personally seen many move out of Google India.
22,10852,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,The most common destination is usually United States for Indian Googlers.
22,10853,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,"That said, if there is an opening in Zurich, the process for transfer is still the same."
22,10854,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,Caveats : Every country has different immigration rules.
22,10855,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,You may or may not be eligible for transfer to a different country due to VISA rules.
22,10856,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,Google cannot help you there.
22,10857,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,There is usually a fixed amount of time you will have to spend in your current job if you want to relocate.
22,10858,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,This usually varies from 12 to 18 months.
22,10859,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,I am guessing that under exceptional cases you may transfer before 1 year but I haven’t seen anyone like that.
22,10860,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,"Sometimes, the whole team decides to relocate to a different country in which case you can choose to stay in your current location and find a different team or relocate with the team."
27,10861,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,*LinkedIn would be one of the choice to reach out to your existing seniors/contact.
76,10862,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,"At what level? I am not telling about GOOGLE, but any reasonable front line tech comp , e.g Intel, Qualcom, Broadcom, Amazon, Microsoft, etc."
76,10863,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,"I'm not mentioning General Dynamics, some of the IBM, Prat Witney, etc; where Indian or non American are not taken for obvious reasons."
76,10864,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,If someone with +15 yrs proper experience may get around +60L/yr CTC.
76,10865,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,Let me put an example : biggest public sector bank of India SBI CEO gets 30L/yr and biggest private sector bank ICICI CEO gets 4-4.5 Cr/yr.
76,10866,2017-05-07 00:00:00,q,But does money matters all time?…may not be.
21,10867,2017-05-11 00:00:00,q,As far as my knowledge is concerned I don't think google doesn't hold or ever faintly hesitate itself from hiring people with physical disability as long as that individual is able enough to offer that the job designation requires from him.
21,10868,2017-05-11 00:00:00,q,Although I feel it my duty to clear that it is highly unlikely that google favors the people with physical disability with a quota of some sorts.
21,10869,2017-05-11 00:00:00,q,You as an individual have to offer the expertise that they require and if you can then google won't hesitate from recruiting you.
73,10870,2017-05-11 00:00:00,q,No we don't have any offices in Kolkata.
73,10871,2017-05-11 00:00:00,q,"Google India has offices in Hyderabad, Gurgaon, Mumbai and Bangalore."
20,10872,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,Every role at Google requires a certain skill set.
20,10873,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,You will need to have those skills for you to be hired.
20,10874,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,No way around it.
20,10875,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"Along with this skill set, you will also need to have  Googliness . It’s a intangible ‘good’ stuff in a person."
20,10876,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,Cannot be defined very easily but you know it’s there as soon as you see it.
20,10877,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"As long you have the skillset and Googliness [1] , Google is going to want to hire you."
20,10878,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,It doesn’t matter what else you think you might be disabled by.
20,10879,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,Google doesn’t care.
20,10880,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,It’s one of the many things I love about this company.
20,10881,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"In fact, I’ll even go out and say that if you feel you’re disabled - physically or otherwise, Google is going to go out of its way to 1."
20,10882,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,Assure you that it won’t affect your growth and 2.
20,10883,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,Do all it can to ensure that you don’t feel that way.
20,10884,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,This place brings me to tears :’) Footnotes [1]  Missions That Matter
113,10885,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"With reference to Zinnov’s latest report on Internet of Things (IoT), I observe a sign of tremendous growth all across the globe and specifically in India."
113,10886,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"It is estimated by Zinnov, that by 2020 the IoT market will increase 3x from $5.6 billion (2015) to $15 billion (2020) in terms of revenue."
113,10887,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"This correspondingly brings focus to the total rise in IoT devices in India which was earlier 0.2 billion (2015) and now estimated to reach 2.7 billion (2020). It can be related with the increased public private partnered initiatives like Smart Cities, Digital India etc."
113,10888,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,India is presently observing a surge in Consumer IoT segment over other Enterprise and Industrial IoT segments due to the widely spreading smartphone market which have micro-targeted specific features to bridge the gaps of their target audience who prefer them only at affordable prices.
113,10889,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"For example, Chinese brands like Vivo, Gionee & Oppo are targeted on Camera which caters the needs of feature phone users who lacked this capability earlier."
113,10890,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,This has cascaded effects on the different use cases developed on top of these features by different tech startups like AR visualization with connectivity to social media and analytic engines to help improve customer experiences.
113,10891,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"Presently, about 50% of these innovative IoT tech-startups are budding in Bengaluru."
113,10892,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"As per the report, major IoT startups in India focus on Infrastructure & Application modules of the IoT stack."
113,10893,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"Telecom & Internet service providers like Jio & other MSO companies have stimulated the urging need of high speed data among consumers, which has eventually triggered focus on networking modules in the stack."
113,10894,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"Thus I can infer from the above observations that Indian market is more inclined towards consumer based IoT applications however with the advent of smart cities, India may soon house almost 25% of the IoT devices across the globe thereby creating more avenues of growth for industrial and enterprise based IoT use cases."
113,10895,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"To keep it simple, India is on growth phase of the IoT lifecycle."
41,10896,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,Excellent question.
41,10897,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,I can answer this in retrospect as I have interned at both places — Google and Directi during my undergrad days as a Software Engineer.
41,10898,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"Contrary to popular perception, the answer is not that straightforward."
41,10899,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"Both Google and Directi are excellent places to work, each of them will offer you a unique set of experiences."
41,10900,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,I learned a ton of things during my tenure at each of these places and it has helped me gather a good perspective right at the start of my career in Computer Science.
41,10901,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"In the remainder of my answer that follows, the comparison that I offer is between the Software Engineering roles for both."
41,10902,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"If you are looking at some other profile, then a lot of the arguments might not hold true."
41,10903,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"Finally, a standard disclaimer — the degree to which my arguments hold true in the OP’s case is in direct proportion to the proximity of our respective circumstances."
41,10904,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"At Google, I was working with a team in Bangalore that was involved with some Machine Learning projects."
41,10905,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"On account of Google's size, one finds all aspects of a typical software engineering workflow highly stream-lined - starting from well-articulated tutorials for beginners to native tools for version control and build."
41,10906,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,There is a feeling of awe that accompanies you most of the time as you contemplate the scale of things that Google works on (as well as its impact) and as you realise the fact that you are working and contributing (albeit in a minuscule proportion) to some of the biggest and most well-maintained C++ code bases in the world.
41,10907,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"And of course, the bragging rights, exclusivity and street-cred among tech nerds that comes along with the brand name is something that goes without saying! If you enjoy order and structure in your work, can perform under clear and cogent set of instructions from management and deliver in accordance to deadlines, then I can see no reason for you to not be satisfied with your experience at Google."
41,10908,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"At Directi, I was part of a team at  Media.net  (the business unit responsible for contextual online ads) where I was again involved with ML/NLP systems that worked towards the larger goal of displaying right ads at the right places."
41,10909,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"The nature of work at Directi, though equally stimulating, was a sharp contrast to Google."
41,10910,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"For most parts, I was in complete control of the modules/systems that I was entrusted to build."
41,10911,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"This meant that I was responsible for formalising and implementing my ideas, collaborating with supporting teams (databases, system admins etc) and pushing the finished product to production."
41,10912,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,I simply loved the freedom and the sense of ownership that comes along with it.
41,10913,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"I got time and space (to a reasonable degree that respects some larger deadlines that were set) to iterate over my ideas, figure out what is working and what is not and pivot accordingly."
41,10914,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"Bureaucracy, when it comes to code, was virtually non-existent."
41,10915,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"The kind of work that I am doing right now (and plan to do for a considerable time in the future), academic research, is closer to my Directi experience than Google."
41,10916,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"In summary, your choice between the two should be governed by the nature as well as the style of work that excites you."
41,10917,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,"While Google taught me the importance of being meticulous and organised , I learned to think from the POV of the end user at Directi."
41,10918,2017-05-13 00:00:00,q,Google made me collaborate with a team and Directi taught me to become independent.
74,10919,2017-05-14 00:00:00,q,SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST The above term is used by me so that I can explain what google is Two million people apply for jobs at google every year.
74,10920,2017-05-14 00:00:00,q,According to google itself getting in google is more difficult than getting in Harvard.
74,10921,2017-05-14 00:00:00,q,But nothing beats a sharp mind and an honest heart If you are lucky enough to get a call from Google and again lucky enough to clear the three standard rounds of interview.
74,10922,2017-05-14 00:00:00,q,You have won yourself a chance to sit there and ask the same question you just asked here.
74,10923,2017-05-14 00:00:00,q,Let me clarify many job at many reputed companies see your capability mentality and sensibility for the role you apply.
74,10924,2017-05-14 00:00:00,q,And if you live up to there standards you get a great amount of salary for that From what I have seen and read Google India offers about 11–20 lakhs of package to its employee others perks and options excluded . ALL THE BEST!
72,10925,2017-05-19 00:00:00,q,Google India jobs requirements would vary depending upon the position one is applying for.
72,10926,2017-05-19 00:00:00,q,"Although Google goes only to reputed colleges for placements, they do not have a constraint for hiring the right candidate from  any  college."
72,10927,2017-05-19 00:00:00,q,"For example, I knew someone who cleared Google interview after doing Bsc from a local college in a small city of Karnataka but had become PM after 12 years experience."
72,10928,2017-05-19 00:00:00,q,The interview went on for 6+ rounds.
72,10929,2017-05-19 00:00:00,q,"Here are the current openings  Search Jobs - Google Careers , apply India as filter and apply for the relevant jobs."
72,10930,2017-05-19 00:00:00,q,"However, since there would 1000s of applications and its waste of time to interview all, HRs would typically go by candidates who have closest experience by working in relevant companies (competitor companies), closest in technology needed and probably sort by college as well."
