There is a lot of bias and favoritism. Agarwals, Guptas, people from Delihi dominate the company. 3. Yearly reviews are a circus. They make their decision first and then use data to either to ding you or promote you. They make the decision based on other reasons and then make up the data to support it. 4. Quality of work is not great either. Everything is automated. Most of the juicy work is done in Seattle. Your work mostly involves using the tools and frameworks developed in Seattle. Work involves mostly modifying UI widgets and some minor changes in existing services. Nothing to be really proud of. 5. Lots of overhead for managers.

The work here isn't technically challenging at all; it is challenging in the sense that you're woken up in the middle of the night and have to fix things however you can, however quickly you can, so that you can be in to work the next day. * If you think you'll learn how to write good code or design complex systems, think again - you're just going to fight fires and write hacky code to quickly patch up someone else's mess. The aim is just speed and secondly, something that works somehow, and the end result is an unprofessional and messy codebase, which even the worst coders in my class in college would've been ashamed of. * Their oncall system is probably the worst. A NOTE TO THOSE WHO ARE ABOUT TO JOIN AMAZON, OR THOSE WHO RECENTLY JOINED: * If you can turn down your offer and continue interviewing elsewhere, I'd suggest doing that. * If you've got no other option, or if you've recently joined, give it a few months; don't assume things will improve - they never do. My first month was an excellent representation of the other 22 months I stayed there. * Keep coding on the side to keep up your design skills. I personally know so many people who were scared to interview at other places, since they felt they'd lost all skills. If you feel the same way, don't worry - some open source coding is good enough to bring you up to scratch. * Don't let their ridiculous stock vesting cycle trap you! You'll lose most of your stocks whenever you leave. * If you realize you're starting to have more headaches, or your blood pressure is beginning to get higher, or if you face any health issues whatsoever, just put in your papers. Those are the first symptoms that things are beginning to go downhill. The adrenalin junkie lifestyle is not for everyone and there's no shame in quitting. * This place scars you for life. I'm still suffering the after-effects, almost 3 years after I've left, and my health is slowly improving (thankfully) now. It also changes your mindset and how you react to things that are normal at a workplace. Less than two years there, and my instinctive reaction to a problem at work has become figuring out a hack; just focus on the extremely short-term and forget about the medium and long-terms. I've also realized I now had trust issues at work. I initially looked at teammates in my new workplace (one of the best companies to work for) as potential backstabbers. I could go on and on, but long story short - STAY AWAY! You do NOT want to ever work here.

Promotions are not based on the years you spent in the same process but it is a result of the metrics you maintain. This is bad for true people who cant lie to customers. People with malpractice have a better chance to grow. This is referred to as 'Smart work' and 'Hard work' has no value and I have seen people getting fired becau …  se of 'Hard work'. 2. Favouritism (the practice of giving unfair preferential treatment to one person or group at the expense of another) exists. If you work really hard, this doesn't matter sometime. You could be your manager's or lead's pet to grow. 3. There is something called 'interim' in almost all next level job. This is easily understood as a 'testing period' for getting promoted in next level. This interim period can last for 3 months to 10 months and if you maintain your metrics then you'll be made / converted to permanent level. It is like You are at Level 2 position and you applied for next level which is L3. This will not be permanent L3. Its like Level 3 (current position) > Interim L4 > L4 (permanent) or Go back to L3 (did not maintained your metrics). You cannot pursue your passion. I moved to one of my favorite dream jobs 2 times, 6 months each by applying internally and still they sent me back to previous level. 4. Unfair Salary. If you are working in Amazon and have 4 years of experience with say 2 lakhs per annum CTC. They hire the candidate externally with say 2 years of experience and offer them 4 lakhs per annum CTC. This is really bad about this company. They do not promote their own employees who are very much capable to do the job in Amazon way. 5. No fun activity at all. The punch line of Amazon is 'Work hard, have fun, make history'. This should be updated to 'Work hard, Work hard, Work hard'. They claim its a Great place to work. I ask, what is Google, Facebook then ? 6. They hired lot of managers from HSBC and other cheap employee unfriendly companies and these managers are bringing those cheapness and unfriendliness along with them and implementing it here. Obviously they all have suffered in their previous company and they want to see Amazonian suffer so that this can give them a balanced satisfaction. One such example is, partially removing the cab facility (Home pickup to home drop) to Shuttle transportation (Point pickup and point drop). Show More"""

The Senior level Employees which include the operation managers and site leaders , I wont ca …  ll them leaders which is what they are called in Amazon as they are part of Amazon leadership team treat associates very badly, like robots paid to do work.

If you have worked in other sites of Amazon Customer service do not come to Pune. If you are new to Amazon and applying to Amazon CS Pune because of Amazon Brand you will be deeply disappointed.

Organization - Anything and everything has a definite structure. Exit point to Entry point, everything is planned already. All I need to do was, follow the map. < …  br>3. Outing & Fun - Amazon seriously believes in HAVE FUN. Every quarter there's a short team outing and a compulsory annual outing which is provided by the company. 4. Work - You need to work hard as Amazon always wanted to be ahead of its competitors and it is. Not updating yourself is a doom. 5. Work stations - Your priority of OS platforms to the machine you need is given. Provided, you need your manager's approval. 6. Perks - I was sanctioned an interest free loan for the cause of Chennai Floods. Every year for my level, I get annual bonus. Some random period of time get 500 INR credited to my Amazon account for shopping. 7. Referral Bonus - Hefty sum for your referrals are sure. Minimum 8K to maximum above 1 lakh INR. Show More"""

Developers - Most of the developers would possess a tremendous amount of technical skills. That's why they're developers in the first place. At the same time, most of them (don't read all of them) has a big bloated ego which would never go down. At all. If you're in a QA team, don't even thin …  k of arguing, because hands down your manager will not be ready to go in war against a developer not even a single one, I tell you. 3. Sticking to same kind of work - If you stick to the same kind of work, people would be so happy to take new dishes from your plate and you eat the same food again and again. That's a sure fire way to stagnate. Again, manager would never bother to ask you for a new task. 4. Leadership Principle Obsession - There are 14 principles formulated by the organization and the managers are so very obsessed to follow them and expect it in your self review. To me it is stupid. 5. Appraisal - Fall once, and you're done for the year. Better luck next time. You would straight away go to Performance Improvement Phase my friend! Nobody can save you! And people are not there to spare your feelings. They would walk over you to get what they want. Watch out for that! 6. Team Change - 80% of the time you won't be having the same manager throughout the year. They change and change and change. Managers, at least in Chennai, are self-centered people who never bother about your growth. They are brutally chasing their dreams and you occupy a negligible amount of space in a farthest workstation who would be visible only when there's a mind-numbing-mundane task comes on their way. 7. Interview Process - Slowest interview process. Most of the times you would be stranded in the feeling where you're selected or not. Mails come only when you're ready to walk away.
