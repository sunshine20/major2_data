34,10116,2017-04-26 00:00:00,q,Let’s first understand the need of Internship pertinent to companies/startups.
34,10117,2017-04-26 00:00:00,q,Companies and especially startups hire folks to get their short-term work done by investing less amount from their pocket.
34,10118,2017-04-26 00:00:00,q,And in case if two or three turn out to be outstanding.
34,10119,2017-04-26 00:00:00,q,They are offered a full time job.
34,10120,2017-04-26 00:00:00,q,"This way companies end up saving money, picking out the right candidates, and getting their work done."
34,10121,2017-04-26 00:00:00,q,"Now, think from the candidates point of view."
34,10122,2017-04-26 00:00:00,q, Why do we do internship? To get the exposure of professional world.

34,10126,2017-04-26 00:00:00,q,":) Consider, you are an intern at company ‘X’ working on Technology ‘T’. You have done tremendous job and got lots of achievement award too."
34,10127,2017-04-26 00:00:00,q,"After your internship is over, you want to work in company ‘Y’ as a full time hire."
34,10128,2017-04-26 00:00:00,q,You applied for the position and got the interview arranged.
34,10129,2017-04-26 00:00:00,q,During interview you get to know the company ‘Y’ uses ‘Z’ technology different than the one you have worked on.
34,10130,2017-04-26 00:00:00,q,So there you are left with your experience.
34,10131,2017-04-26 00:00:00,q,Only your experience will take you through the interview process because perhaps an interviewer doesn’t know about your previous technology you had worked on.

64,10137,2017-04-29 00:00:00,q,In india Amazon is a marketplace so they dont actually own any of the inventory.
64,10138,2017-04-29 00:00:00,q,"But in order to protect customer interest they have an a to z guarantee on products that are fulfilled via their network, just in case u end up with something that you deem is not genuine."
27,10139,2017-04-30 00:00:00,q,"As far as I know Amazon came to KIIT last year and this year as well, but very few candidates were taken (less than 5 I guess). Even if they do take candidates, it will be a very small number and the package will be lesser than other colleges."

80,10188,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,Being an online seller we are qualified to answer this question.
80,10189,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,Amazon is pretty faster in delivering orders as it has its own courier service.
80,10190,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,Amazon has two types of delivery services Amazon Easy ship -In this type of shipping they ask seller to make the parcel ready in Amazon provided packaging material.The address and other docs are attached with the parcel at the premises of seller.The courier guy from Amazon are very professional and will come on time to pick up the parcel.If the seller fails to handover the parcel on time then Amazon gives negative ratings to the seller.Rating is very important for a seller on market places.
80,10191,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,Another delivery service is  Amazon prime  wherein the material is kept at nearest Amazon warehouse(Amazon charges nominal fee from the seller for the same).Amazon has excellent network of its warehouses and pick up facilities across the country.
80,10192,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,Prime is faster than easy ship.
80,10193,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,Amazon is highly customer oriented and takes utmost care in delivering the parcel.They will call you for feedback after the parcel is delivered.
80,10194,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,The delivery from Flipkart is not as faster as that of Amazon.
80,10195,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,Standard Delivery : Flipkart also has its own courier service  Ekart . The service of Ekart is not fast.
80,10196,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,They lack that professionalism which we see in Amazon guys.The return rate is more in case of Flipkart due to late delivery.
80,10197,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,FA(Flipkart Assured):-  This is comparatively better than standard delivery.
80,10198,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,Flipkart Assured badge is not an entitlement or a privilege.
80,10199,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,Neither is it available to select customers or select sellers.
80,10200,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,"The Flipkart Assured badge is accorded by an algorithm, developed by Flipkart data scientists, which computes key product and seller metrics along with stringent quality parameters."
80,10201,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,Only select products from Flipkart’s most trusted and reliable sellers qualify for a badge.
80,10202,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,A product is eligible to earn the Flipkart Assured badge only if it passes extensive checks on seller and product quality as well as availability of faster shipping.
80,10203,2017-05-04 00:00:00,q,Overall Amazon has faster delivery than Flipkart.
63,10204,2017-05-05 00:00:00,q,"Yes, couple of our users have won from this contest, especially the treasure hunt one which offered lots of items at Rs.1 only."
63,10205,2017-05-05 00:00:00,q,Amazon is genuine in distributing prizes and they really dont show case it though that sometime creates doubts from users.. Happy contesting.

15,10210,2017-05-06 00:00:00,q,You know what to look for that is seller ratings and stuff to ensure you get a genuine product.
15,10211,2017-05-06 00:00:00,q,But they would charge you for import and stuff and the warranty also won't be valid in India so you will have to Shell out money from your pocket or send the product to US for warranty.
15,10212,2017-05-06 00:00:00,q,And the return policy would be the same and in case you want to return it it would mostly be a slef return so be ready for that as well.
15,10213,2017-05-06 00:00:00,q,So in case any one is coming from US to India it is better you ask them to bring it for you so that they can test the laptop before buying and you need not worry about damage in transit or DOA :P

61,10218,2017-05-06 00:00:00,q,You will basically have to check for fraudulent activities and take actions as per policy.

70,10239,2017-05-09 00:00:00,q,Nope there is no way atleast on earth to pay half money in prepaid and half on COD atleast on Amazon . This applies to all the amazon websites . Its the policy of Amazon which can't be breached.
70,10240,2017-05-09 00:00:00,q,The only way is either buy something under that amazon pay balance amount or if it exceeds so have to pay via Debit/Credit card or NetBanking.
70,10241,2017-05-09 00:00:00,q,The other solution is if you don't own any card or netbanking i would suggest you to get one . Or the last solution is some banks provide prepaid cards like for Rs.1000 that has Rs.

57,10321,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,Following are my reasons Lower trust on sellers.
57,10322,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q," I trust flipkart, but not its sellers."
57,10323,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,Same with snapdeal.

57,10334,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,because of huge number of genuine reviews.
57,10335,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q," They could have implemented strict quality control (seal checking etc) and warehousing(like amazon fulfilled), but they allowed sellers to fool their customers."
57,10336,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"Diluted strong fundamentals . If I were to analyse Flipkart from how they started to what they are - one thing is clear -  they used to prioritize core things like - quality, delivery, customer service  etc."
57,10337,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,during initial days.
57,10338,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"Now a days, those took a back seat, and it is marketing, gimmicks and similar BS."
57,10339,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,Low choice inventory.
57,10340,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q, I used to be able to buy my computer components like internal hard disk etc from WS Retails.
57,10341,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,Now many of the ciompnents are not even listed by the sellers.
57,10342,2017-05-12 00:00:00,q,"In short, flipkart has changed form a  upmarket midsized high quality supermarket to xxxxl-sized low quality fish market."

93,10363,2017-05-14 00:00:00,q,"Later on followed up customer's account to see he gets two packages, one which he originally ordered and another one which we gave."

83,10401,2017-05-17 00:00:00,q,If the package is rejected there are very least chances that the product can again be delivered.
83,10402,2017-05-17 00:00:00,q,"Better, first try calling the Delivery Agent first."
83,10403,2017-05-17 00:00:00,q,Try calling the Delivery Agent on the number from which he contacted you regarding the delivery.
83,10404,2017-05-17 00:00:00,q,"If calling the DA is not helpful, then you can contact the Amazon Customer Service."
83,10405,2017-05-17 00:00:00,q,Most probably even they won't be able to assure you regarding the delivery because once the package is rejected it would be returned back to the seller immediately.
83,10406,2017-05-17 00:00:00,q,"If luckily the product is available at the local station , there would be chances that the product can be redelivered . Once the package is marked as rejected knowingly or unknowingly there are very least chances that the product can be re-delivered."

13,10408,2017-05-18 00:00:00,q,There is a  NEW TRICK  going on  Amazon  now a days to cheat people.
13,10409,2017-05-18 00:00:00,q,Happened with me.
13,10410,2017-05-18 00:00:00,q,A product will be shown as excessively discounted.
13,10411,2017-05-18 00:00:00,q,"For example, I was looking for Crocs shoes, MRP 6000, they were available on sale at whopping Rs.2000, I knew it is a good deal so I purchased the product."
13,10412,2017-05-18 00:00:00,q,As a human psychology if you purchase one product you also purchase many other products may be somewhat cheaper and lying for a long time from your wish list (also to avoid delivery charges). Now the real work begins - The order for heavily discounted product will be  Cancelled  saying it is not available in inventory (then why it was showing available in the first place?) and the other products will be delivered.
13,10413,2017-05-18 00:00:00,q,"Now if you have not purchased the cancelled product you probably would have ignored the other products also, but by looking at heavily discounted product you purchased other products as well."
13,10414,2017-05-18 00:00:00,q,In this way wrong pricing of a dummy product can be used to instigate you to buy other products.

92,10418,2017-05-18 00:00:00,q,"Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers."
92,10419,2017-05-18 00:00:00,q,This is something every person inside the Amazon is expected to follow.
92,10420,2017-05-18 00:00:00,q,"Therefore, whenever Amazon’s Customer Care Associates get a call from customers they talk politely and humbly."
92,10421,2017-05-18 00:00:00,q,"Keeping in mind, customer satisfaction is the top most thing to achieve and rest will come later."

23,10428,2017-05-20 00:00:00,q,"However, for seller fulfilled products is more about a personal choice and your risk appetite."
43,10429,2017-05-20 00:00:00,q,I’ve ordered many products on Amazon.
43,10430,2017-05-20 00:00:00,q,"Actually, Amazon is trying to cater to all Indian cities/states, as many as possible."
43,10431,2017-05-20 00:00:00,q,"Now, there are some regions where companies like Blue Dart, Fed Ex, might not have services."
43,10432,2017-05-20 00:00:00,q,"There are these regional/local players like DTDC, Maruti Courier, Professional, GATI, who have good penetration in remote areas."
43,10433,2017-05-20 00:00:00,q,"Hence, based on your location, it is automatically assigned to the concerned courier who can deliver it to you."

42,10439,2017-05-21 00:00:00,q,"Outsourced Seller Support Associates Amazon direct Seller Support Associates Outsourced agents work for Amazon on second party pay rolls and have very limited tools, so they only handle basic sellers query."
42,10440,2017-05-21 00:00:00,q,Whereas the Amazon direct Seller Support associates are very well equipped and can resolve most of the seller queries.
42,10441,2017-05-21 00:00:00,q,They are well paid and trained in house by Amazon.
42,10442,2017-05-21 00:00:00,q,They work from HYD and BLR site offices.
42,10443,2017-05-21 00:00:00,q,"Usually all associates are trained to provide best seller experience, but sometimes I noticed due to above limitation the Outsourced Seller Support Associates are unable to meet seller expectation."
42,10444,2017-05-21 00:00:00,q,"Conclusion:  If you have bad experience, you can ask them to tranfer call to main site in HYD or BLR where you can speak with direct Amazon associate, if still unhappy you can ask them to connect to their managers."
